# The Hong Kong Massacre save file editor
This is a simple project to edit [The Hong Kong Massacre](https://store.steampowered.com/app/741510/The_Hong_Kong_Massacre/) save files.

## Download
Download from [releases](https://github.com/HirbodBehnam/THKM-Save-Editor/releases)

### Build
I've build this with Visual Studio 2019 and .Net Framework 2. You could probably build this on older visual studios too.

## Editing other params
Save file will be loaded [here](https://github.com/HirbodBehnam/THKM-Save-Editor/blob/master/THKM%20Save%20Editor/Main.cs#L94). It is also stored in [_save](https://github.com/HirbodBehnam/THKM-Save-Editor/blob/master/THKM%20Save%20Editor/Main.cs#L13) value after that. After changing the value you wanted, there is no need to change the save function.

## Compatibility
Tested with THKM v1.04.
